# GreenHouse-Project
greenhouse using Multisim and components found in the laboratory
The purpose of the course is to build and design a system to use a smart greenhouse for growing cannabis using technologies and planning
For this, there is a requirement of control and control over four parameters.
Temperature in the greenhouse, seedling humidity, entry and exit regulation (doors) and greenhouse lighting.
Each parameter was tested and simulated, all while maintaining diskette circuits. The hardware planning was done in the Multisim simulation software and simulations were performed for the correctness of the circuit. Finally, all the blocks were implemented on a connection matrix and laboratory tests were carried out on the integrity of the circuits.
